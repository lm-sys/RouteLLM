Which of the following observations provides evidence that the portion of the wave hitting the child’s ankles carries less energy than the wave did when it was first created by the rock’s impact?
A. The wave is moving more slowly.
B. The wave pulse’s width has become greater.
C. The wave pulse’s width has become smaller.
D. The wave’s height has become smaller.
Answer:",True,True
"Physics students are checking the constant acceleration equations of kinematics by measuring the velocity of a tennis ball that is dropped and falls 6 meters and then passes through a photogate. The predicted velocity is 20% above the velocity measured by the photogate. Which of the following best describes the cause of the large percent difference?
A. The ball changes its shape while falling.
B. The acceleration of gravity varies as the ball is falling.
C. Air resistance increases the acceleration of the ball.
D. The acceleration of the balls varies with the velocity.
Answer:",False,False
"Mercury orbits the sun in about one-fifth of an Earth year. If 1 AU is defined as the distance from the Earth to the sun, what is the approximate distance between Mercury and the sun?
A. (1/25) AU
B. (1/9) AU
C. (1/5) AU
D. (1/3) AU
Answer:",False,False
"The Gravitron is a carnival ride that looks like a large cylinder. People stand inside the cylinder against the wall as it begins to spin. Eventually, it is rotating fast enough that the floor can be removed without anyone falling. Given then the coefficient of friction between a person’s clothing and the wall is μ, the tangential speed is v, and the radius of the ride is R, what is greatest mass that a person can be to safely go on this ride?
A. μv^2/(rg)
B. r^2v^2/(μg)
C. rg/(μv^2)
D. None of the above.
Answer:",False,False
"An artificial satellite orbits Earth just above the atmosphere in a circle with constant speed. A small meteor collides with the satellite at point P in its orbit, increasing its speed by 1%, but not changing the instantaneous direction of the satellite’s velocity. Which of the following describes the satellite’s new orbit?
A. The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the farthest approach to Earth.
B. The satellite now orbits in an ellipse, with P as the closest approach to Earth.
C. The satellite now orbits in a circle of larger radius.
D. The satellite now orbits in a circle of smaller radius.
Answer:",False,False
